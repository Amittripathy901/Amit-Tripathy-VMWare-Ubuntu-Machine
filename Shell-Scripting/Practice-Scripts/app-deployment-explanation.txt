Let's walk through the script step by step and explain what happens at each stage. Imagine you have a project hosted on GitHub that you want to update, build, and then deploy to a web server. For example, suppose:

Repository URL: https://github.com/example/myproject.git
Deployment Directory: /var/www/myproject (this is where your project is checked out)
Branch: main
Build Directory: /var/www/myproject/build (where you run your build commands)
Here's how the script works:

1. Defining Variables
bash
Copy
Edit
REPO_URL="https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git"
TARGET_DIR="/path/to/deployment/directory"   # Directory where the repo is checked out
BRANCH="main"                                  # Branch to deploy
BUILD_DIR="/path/to/build/dir"                 # Directory where the build process occurs
Explanation:
The script sets up variables to store the Git repository URL, the directory where your code is deployed, the branch you want to update, and the directory where you'll build your project.
Example:
You might set:
bash
Copy
Edit
REPO_URL="https://github.com/example/myproject.git"
TARGET_DIR="/var/www/myproject"
BRANCH="main"
BUILD_DIR="/var/www/myproject/build"
2. Updating the Code from the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Updating code from the repository: $REPO_URL..."
cd "$TARGET_DIR" || { echo "Error: TARGET_DIR not found: $TARGET_DIR"; exit 1; }
git pull origin "$BRANCH" || { echo "Error: git pull failed"; exit 1; }
Explanation:
The script prints a message indicating itâ€™s updating the code.
It changes the directory to your deployment directory (TARGET_DIR).
If that directory does not exist, the command after || runs: it prints an error and exits.
It then pulls the latest changes from the specified branch from the Git repository.
Example:
In our case, the script goes to /var/www/myproject and runs:
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
This updates your local copy with the latest code from GitHub.
3. Building the Project
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Building the project..."
cd "$BUILD_DIR" || { echo "Error: BUILD_DIR not found: $BUILD_DIR"; exit 1; }
Explanation:
It prints a message that the build process is starting.
It changes to the build directory where your build commands are executed.
The script checks if the build directory exists; if not, it prints an error and exits.
Example:
For a Node.js project, you might later insert a command like:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install && npm run build || { echo "Error: Build failed"; exit 1; }
This would install dependencies and build your project, resulting in a production-ready bundle in your build directory.
4. Deploying the Project
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Deploying the project..."
# Insert your deploy commands here.
# For example, copying the build output to the deployment directory:
# cp -R "$BUILD_DIR/dist/." "$TARGET_DIR/deployed_app/" || { echo "Error: Deployment failed"; exit 1; }
Explanation:
The script prints a message that it is now deploying the project.
Here, you would insert commands that move your built files to the location where they should run.
The commented-out cp command is an example: it would copy everything from a dist folder inside the build directory to a deployed_app folder in the deployment directory.
Example:
Suppose your build creates files in /var/www/myproject/build/dist and you want these files to be served from /var/www/myproject/public. You might use:
bash
Copy
Edit
cp -R "$BUILD_DIR/dist/." "/var/www/myproject/public/" || { echo "Error: Deployment failed"; exit 1; }
This command copies all built files and, if it fails, prints an error message and exits.
5. Completion Message
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Deployment Complete!"
Explanation:
Finally, the script prints a confirmation message indicating that the deployment process has finished successfully.
Full Flow with an Example:
Start:
You run the script manually or via a cron job.

Update Code:
The script navigates to /var/www/myproject, pulls the latest changes from https://github.com/example/myproject.git on the main branch.

Build:
It moves to /var/www/myproject/build and runs your build command (e.g., npm install && npm run build), generating your production files.

Deploy:
Then, it copies the build output (say from /var/www/myproject/build/dist) to your deployment directory (say /var/www/myproject/public).

Finish:
You see the message "Deployment Complete!" and your application is updated and running with the latest code.
